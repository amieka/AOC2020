#### What is this ?

This is my take on solving the AOC DAY 20. This is a work in progress.

Running the program as is will yield a solution for the first part.
Stay tuned for the second part :)

#### Note on running the program
If you are on a mac and your system's default python version is 2.7x then you will need to install `python3` if not already installed via `HomeBrew`

Instructions:
 - https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python
 - Ensure python3 is installed by running `which python3`.
 - Clone or fork this repo.
 - Create a virtual env on inside the root folder of this repo by running : `python3 -m venv .`
 - Optional - (Install the code formatter dependency `black`) by running `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

How to run:
- Change into the solution directory for a specific day of the contest (At the moment I have the part 1 of the solution for DAY 20)
- Ex: `cd DAY20`
- Run: `python solver.py`
